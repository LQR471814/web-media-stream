# web-media-stream

A website / webserver that allows you to stream webcam and microphone input over the network. Powered by WebRTC, Web Audio API, Leader-Line.js and Golang!

#### NOTE: This is not secure despite using `https` schema so one should really only use it over LAN.

### Usage

Simply run the server then navigate to `<your_ip_address>:3000` to view the webpage!

The `Client` is the one that sends microphone and video input while the `Viewer` receives it and displays it on a webpage.
